Variables and functions can be accessed before or after their definitions.
Doing so 
Will always return 'undefined' for variables. 
Functions are called normally for regular functions

Eg : 
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 2;
console.log(a); // 2

demo(); // Allowed and prints hi
function demo(){
    console.log(`hi`);
}

Function expressions can be accesed only after their expression

Eg: 
addition(2, 4); will throw 'addition is not a function' error
var addition = function add(m, n){
    console.log(m + n);
}
addition(5, 7); //12
